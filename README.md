# IR_ESP32_ALEXA

for each new void you add,
discover new device in others and it will bestate the ar name you defined
with the same esp you can configure several

watch this one to see how to do it right with the air
https://github.com/nugoo1/Alexa-IR-Remote/blob/master/Office_AC/Office_AC.ino

see the irremote libs and have the device brands
if not, capture the raw and send it as iralexaotherdevices (save this one I did) - currently iralexav2


Future ideas:
 
Record everything and then put the subtitles
talk about the basics you need to know about electronics and automation:
having wires, breadboard, an esp32, the hardware
Motivation: I didn't find videos

arduino ide installed, esp32 board installed: leave videos that explain this
1 video: general process, explaining everything that will be done and the automation working
2 video: recording the nec and e codes

ALEXA APP, CONTROL THERE also

samsung special section
special: alexa routines
special: air conditioning by combining controls
you can send it with the raw method, with the uint8_t, nec or with the samsung lib
uint has to be 14
